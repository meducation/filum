Each line logged \r\nduring that operation automatically contains the context id. \r\n\r\nThis can be used for operations which span multi process. A context id can be\r\npassed between the processes. Log lines from both processes will contain the\r\ncontext id, allowing the tracking of the single operation through\r\nall the processes individual log files.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'filum'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you!! :heart::sparkling_heart::heart:\r\n\r\nWe'd love to have you involved.
